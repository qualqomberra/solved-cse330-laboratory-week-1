<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">This is a “warm-up” and exploratory first CSE 330 lab. Work on the exercises in the order given, and see how far you get. You may ask basic C++ questions and get some help with debugging, but overall you should try to manage with minimal help.  Each warms up at their own pace.  </span>




<strong>Exercise 1: </strong>Write a complete C++ program which reads in an odd number of integer values. These values are to be stored in a vector&lt;int&gt;. Among the stored values there should be no repeated values. The stored values should be contained in the vector should not be ordered.




Task: The program is to determine the “median element” in the vector; it should do so without prior sorting of the vector.




<strong>Exercise 2:</strong> You may simply add on to your program of Exercise 1 … Write a function which will print out the values of a vector&lt;int&gt; without any iteration. That is, your function is not allowed to use any for-, while-, or do-while loops.




<strong>Exercise 3:</strong> Again, you can simply add on the existing program … Write a function which will return the maximal value of a vector&lt;int&gt;. Again, the function is not allowed to use iteration (loops).




<strong>To obtain credit for this lab:  </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<ul>

 <li>Before you leave the lab (not before 3pm), sign off on a signup sheet that will be passed around.</li>

 <li>A portal will be opened Lab 1; electronically submit your best effort (in a single .cpp file) for this lab by 11:59pm of the day following the lab (Mà W, W à F).</li>

</ul>




Your electronic submission will not be “graded” in a traditional sense, but in order to obtain full credit for the lab, your submission should show a substantial and sincere effort on your part.
